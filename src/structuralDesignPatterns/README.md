#Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for
example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from
small objects.

There are five creational design patterns:
- Adapter Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Decorator Pattern

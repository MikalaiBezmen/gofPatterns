#Bridge Pattern
When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as
implementations, then builder design pattern is used to decouple the
interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from
the client programs. Like Adapter pattern, its one of the Structural design
pattern.

According to GoF bridge design pattern is:

`Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so
 that the two can vary independently`
 
The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer
Composition over inheritance.

Bridge design pattern can be used when both abstraction and implementation
can have different hierarchies independently and we want to hide the
implementation from the client application.

#Builder Pattern
Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern like Factory Pattern
and Abstract Factory Pattern. This pattern was introduced to solve some
of the problems with Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns when the
Object contains a lot of attributes.

There are three major issues with Factory and Abstract Factory design
patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes.
1. Too Many arguments to pass from client program to the Factory class
that can be error prone because most of the time, the type of
arguments are same and from client side itâ€™s hard to maintain the
order of the argument.
2. Some of the parameters might be optional but in Factory pattern, we
are forced to send all the parameters and optional parameters need to
send as NULL.
3. If the object is heavy and its creation is complex, then all that
complexity will be part of Factory classes that is confusing.

We can solve the issues with large number of parameters by providing a
constructor with required parameters and then different setter methods to set
the optional parameters but the problem with this is that the Object state will
be inconsistent until unless all the attributes are set explicitly.

Builder pattern solves the issue with large number of optional parameters
and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step
and provide a method that will actually return the final Object.

##Builder Design Pattern Example in JDK
- java.lang.StringBuilder#append() (unsynchronized)
- java.lang.StringBuffer#append() (synchronized)

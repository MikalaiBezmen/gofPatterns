#Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate an object in the best
possible way for specific situations.

The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add
unwanted complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this
problem by controlling the object creation by different ways.

There are five creational design patterns that we will discuss in this eBook.
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern

All these patterns solve specific problems with object creation, so you
should understand and use them when needed.

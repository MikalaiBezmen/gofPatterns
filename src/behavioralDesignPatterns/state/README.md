# State Pattern
State pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. State design pattern
is used when an Object change its behavior based on its internal state.

If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can
have a state variable in the Object and use if-else condition block to perform
different actions based on the state. State pattern is used to provide a
systematic and lose-coupled way to achieve this through Context and State
implementations.

Context is the class that has a State reference to one of the concrete
implementations of the State and forwards the request to the state object for
processing.

The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is
clearly visible, the chances of error are less and itâ€™s very easy to add more
states for additional behavior making it more robust, easily maintainable and
flexible. Also State pattern helped in avoiding if-else or switch-case
conditional logic in this scenario.

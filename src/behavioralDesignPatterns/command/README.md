# Command Pattern
Command Pattern is one of the Behavioral Design Pattern and it’s used
to implement lose coupling in a request-response model. In command
pattern, the request is send to the invoker and invoker pass it to the
encapsulated command object. Command object passes the request to the
appropriate method of Receiver to perform the specific action. The client
program create the receiver object and then attach it to the Command. Then
it creates the invoker object and attach the command object to perform an
action. Now when client program executes the action, it’s processed based
on the command and receiver object.

## Command Pattern JDK Example
Runnable interface (java.lang.Runnable) and Swing Action
(javax.swing.Action) uses command pattern.
## Important Points
- Command is the core of this pattern that defines the contract for
implementation.
- Receiver implementation is separate from command implementation.
- Command implementation classes chose the method to invoke on
receiver object, for every method in receiver there will be a command
implementation. It works as a bridge between receiver and action
methods.
Invoker class just forward the request from client to the command
object.
- Client is responsible to instantiate appropriate command and receiver
implementation and then associate them together.
- Client is also responsible for instantiating invoker object and
associating command object with it and execute the action method.
- Command pattern is easily extendable, we can add new action
methods in receivers and create new Command implementations
without changing the client code.
- The drawback with Command pattern is that the code gets huge and
confusing with high number of action methods and because of so
many associations.

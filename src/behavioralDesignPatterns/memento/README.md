#Memento Pattern
Memento pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Memento
design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we
can restore later on. Memento pattern is used to implement this in such a
way that the saved state data of the object is not accessible outside of the
object, this protects the integrity of saved state data.

Memento pattern is implemented with two objects – Originator and
Caretaker. Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and
restored and it uses an inner class to save the state of Object. The inner class
is called Memento and its private, so that it can’t be accessed from other
objects.

Caretaker is the helper class that is responsible for storing and restoring the
Originator’s state through Memento object. Since Memento is private to
Originator, Caretaker can’t access it and it’s stored as a Object within the
caretaker.

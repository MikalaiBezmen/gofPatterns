# GoF Patterns
## Design Patterns Overview
**Design Patterns** are very popular among software developers. A design
pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.
Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:
- Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard
approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly
use the design pattern.
- Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to
more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total
cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
- Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to
understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new
members of team understand it easily.

Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories:
- Creational
- Structural
- Behavioral

### Creational Design Patterns
Creational design patterns provide solution to instantiate an object in the best
possible way for specific situations.

The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or add
unwanted complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this
problem by controlling the object creation by different ways.

There are five creational design patterns:
- Singleton Pattern
- Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Prototype Pattern

All these patterns solve specific problems with object creation, so you
should understand and use them when needed.
#### 1. Abstract Factory Pattern
Abstract Factory is one of the Creational pattern and almost similar to
Factory Pattern except the fact that it’s more like factory of factories.
If you are familiar with factory design pattern in java, you will notice that
we have a single Factory class that returns the different sub-classes based on
the input provided and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to
achieve this.

In Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory
class for each sub-class and then an Abstract Factory class that will return
the sub-class based on the input factory class. At first it seems confusing but
once you see the implementation, it’s really easy to grasp and understand the
minor difference between Factory and Abstract Factory pattern.
##### Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern
- Abstract Factory pattern provides approach to code for interface rather
than implementation.
- Abstract Factory pattern is “factory of factories” and can be easily
extended to accommodate more products, for example we can add
another sub-class Laptop and a factory LaptopFactory.
- Abstract Factory pattern is robust and avoid conditional logic of
Factory pattern.
##### Abstract Factory Pattern Examples in JDK
- javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()
- javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()
- javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance()

#### 2. Builder Pattern
Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern like Factory Pattern
and Abstract Factory Pattern. This pattern was introduced to solve some
of the problems with Factory and Abstract Factory design patterns when the
Object contains a lot of attributes.

There are three major issues with Factory and Abstract Factory design
patterns when the Object contains a lot of attributes.
1. Too Many arguments to pass from client program to the Factory class
that can be error prone because most of the time, the type of
arguments are same and from client side it’s hard to maintain the
order of the argument.
2. Some of the parameters might be optional but in Factory pattern, we
are forced to send all the parameters and optional parameters need to
send as NULL.
3. If the object is heavy and its creation is complex, then all that
complexity will be part of Factory classes that is confusing.

We can solve the issues with large number of parameters by providing a
constructor with required parameters and then different setter methods to set
the optional parameters but the problem with this is that the Object state will
be inconsistent until unless all the attributes are set explicitly.

Builder pattern solves the issue with large number of optional parameters
and inconsistent state by providing a way to build the object step-by-step
and provide a method that will actually return the final Object.

##### Builder Design Pattern Example in JDK
- java.lang.StringBuilder#append() (unsynchronized)
- java.lang.StringBuffer#append() (synchronized)

#### 3. Factory Pattern
Factory Pattern is one of the Creational Design pattern and it’s widely
used in JDK as well as frameworks like Spring and Struts.

Factory design pattern is used when we have a super class with multiple subclasses
and based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class. This
pattern take out the responsibility of instantiation of a class from client
program to the factory class. Let’s first learn how to implement factory
pattern in java and then we will learn its benefits and we will see its usage in
JDK.

![Class Diagram](src/creationalDesignPatterns/factory/FactoryPatternClassDiagram.png)
##### Benefits of Factory Pattern
- Factory pattern provides approach to code for interface rather than
implementation.
- Factory pattern removes the instantiation of actual implementation
classes from client code, making it more robust, less coupled and easy
to extend. For example, we can easily change PC class
implementation because client program is unaware of this.
- Factory pattern provides abstraction between implementation and
client classes through inheritance.
#####Factory Pattern Examples in JDK
- java.util.Calendar, ResourceBundle and NumberFormat getInstance()
methods uses Factory pattern.
- valueOf() method in wrapper classes like Boolean, Integer etc.

#### 4. Prototype Pattern
Prototype pattern is one of the Creational Design pattern, so it provides a
mechanism of object creation. Prototype pattern is used when the Object
creation is a costly affair and requires a lot of time and resources and you
have a similar object already existing. So this pattern provides a mechanism
to copy the original object to a new object and then modify it according to
our needs. This pattern uses java cloning to copy the object.

It would be easy to understand this pattern with an example, suppose we
have an Object that loads data from database. Now we need to modify this
data in our program multiple times, so it’s not a good idea to create the
Object using _new_ keyword and load all the data again from database. So the
better approach is to clone the existing object into a new object and then do
the data manipulation.

Prototype design pattern mandates that the Object which you are copying
should provide the copying feature. It should not be done by any other class.
However whether to use shallow or deep copy of the Object properties
depends on the requirements and it’s a design decision.

#### 5. Singleton Pattern
Singleton is one of the Gangs of Four Design patterns and comes in
the Creational Design Pattern category. From the definition, it seems to be
a very simple design pattern but when it comes to implementation, it comes
with a lot of implementation concerns. The implementation of Singleton
pattern has always been a controversial topic among developers. Here we
will learn about Singleton design pattern principles, different ways to
implement Singleton and some of the best practices for its usage.

Singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class and ensures that only
one instance of the class exists in the java virtual machine. The singleton
class must provide a global access point to get the instance of the class.
Singleton pattern is used for logging, driver objects, caching and thread
pool.

Singleton design pattern is also used in other design patterns like Abstract
Factory, Builder, Prototype, Facade etc. Singleton design pattern is used in
core java classes also, for example java.lang.Runtime, java.awt.Desktop.

To implement Singleton pattern, we have different approaches but all of
them have following common concepts.
- Private constructor to restrict instantiation of the class from other
classes.
- Private static variable of the same class that is the only instance of the
class.
- Public static method that returns the instance of the class, this is the
global access point for outer world to get the instance of the singleton
class.

### Structural Design Patterns
Structural patterns provide different ways to create a class structure, for
example using inheritance and composition to create a large object from
small objects.

There are five creational design patterns:
- Adapter Pattern
- Composite Pattern
- Proxy Pattern
- Flyweight Pattern
- Facade Pattern
- Bridge Pattern
- Decorator Pattern

#### 1. Adapter Design Pattern
Adapter design pattern is one of the structural design pattern and it’s
used so that two unrelated interfaces can work together. The object that joins
these unrelated interface is called an Adapter. As a real life example, we
can think of a mobile charger as an adapter because mobile battery needs 3
volts to charge but the normal socket produces either 120V (US) or 240V
(India). So the mobile charger works as an adapter between mobile charging
socket and the wall socket.

![Class Diagram](src/structuralDesignPatterns/adapter/AdapterPatternClassDiagram.png)

Two Way Adapter Pattern
While implementing Adapter pattern, there are two approaches – class
adapter and object adapter, however both these approaches produce same
result.
1. Class Adapter – This form uses java inheritance and extends the
source interface, in our case Socket class.
2. Object Adapter – This form uses Java Composition and adapter
contains the source object.

##### Adapter Pattern Example in JDK
- java.util.Arrays#asList()
- java.io.InputStreamReader(InputStream) (returns a Reader)
- java.io.OutputStreamWriter(OutputStream) (returns a Writer)

#### 2. Bridge Pattern
When we have interface hierarchies in both interfaces as well as
implementations, then builder design pattern is used to decouple the
interfaces from implementation and hiding the implementation details from
the client programs. Like Adapter pattern, its one of the Structural design
pattern.

According to GoF bridge design pattern is:

`Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so
 that the two can vary independently`

![Class Diagram](src/structuralDesignPatterns/bridge/BridgePatternClassDiagram.png)

The implementation of bridge design pattern follows the notion to prefer
Composition over inheritance.

Bridge design pattern can be used when both abstraction and implementation
can have different hierarchies independently and we want to hide the
implementation from the client application.

####3. Composite Pattern
Composite pattern is one of the Structural design pattern and is used
when we have to represent a part-whole hierarchy. When we need to create a
structure in a way that the objects in the structure has to be treated the same
way, we can apply composite design pattern.

Composite Pattern consists of following objects.
1. Base Component – Base component is the interface for all objects in
the composition, client program uses base component to work with
the objects in the composition. It can be an interface or an abstract
class with some methods common to all the objects.
2. Leaf – Defines the behaviour for the elements in the composition. It is
the building block for the composition and implements base
component. It doesn’t have references to other Components.
3. Composite – It consists of leaf elements and implements the
operations in base component.

![Class Diagram](src/structuralDesignPatterns/composite/CompositePatternClassDiagram.png)

##### Important Points about Composite Pattern
- Composite pattern should be applied only when the group of objects
should behave as the single object.
- Composite pattern can be used to create a tree like structure.

java.awt.Container#add(Component) is a great example of Composite
pattern in java and used a lot in Swing.

####4. Decorator Pattern
Decorator design pattern is used to modify the functionality of an object at
runtime. At the same time other instances of the same class will not be
affected by this, so individual object gets the modified behavior. Decorator
design pattern is one of the structural design pattern (such as Adapter
Pattern, Bridge Pattern, Composite Pattern) and uses abstract classes or
interface with composition to implement.

![Class Diagram](src/structuralDesignPatterns/decorator/DecoratorPatternClassDiagram.png)

Important Points
- Decorator pattern is helpful in providing runtime modification
abilities and hence more flexible. It’s easy to maintain and extend
when the number of choices are more.
- The disadvantage of decorator pattern is that it uses a lot of similar
kind of objects (decorators).
- Decorator pattern is used a lot in Java IO classes, such as FileReader,
BufferedReader etc.

#### 5. Facade Pattern
Facade Pattern is one of the Structural design patterns (such as Adapter
pattern and Decorator pattern) and used to help client applications to easily
interact with the system.
According to GoF Facade design pattern is:

`Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a
 subsystem. Facade Pattern defines a higher-level
 interface that makes the subsystem easier to use`
 
Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade
Pattern defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to
use.
 
Important Points
- Facade pattern is more like a helper for client applications, it doesn’t
hide subsystem interfaces from the client. Whether to use Facade or
not is completely dependent on client code.
- Facade pattern can be applied at any point of development, usually
when the number of interfaces grow and system gets complex.
- Subsystem interfaces are not aware of Facade and they shouldn’t have
any reference of the Facade interface.
- Facade pattern should be applied for similar kind of interfaces, its
purpose is to provide a single interface rather than multiple interfaces
that does the similar kind of jobs.
- We can use Factory pattern with Facade to provide better interface to
client systems.
 
#### 6. Flyweight Pattern
According to GoF, flyweight design pattern intent is:

`Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained
 objects efficiently`
 
Flyweight design pattern is a Structural design pattern like Facade pattern,
Adapter Pattern and Decorator pattern. Flyweight design pattern is used
when we need to create a lot of Objects of a class. Since every object
consumes memory space that can be crucial for low memory devices, such
as mobile devices or embedded systems, flyweight design pattern can be
applied to reduce the load on memory by sharing objects.
Before we apply flyweight design pattern, we need to consider following
factors:
- The number of Objects to be created by application should be huge.
- The object creation is heavy on memory and it can be time consuming
too.
- The object properties can be divided into intrinsic and extrinsic
properties, extrinsic properties of an Object should be defined by the
client program.

To apply flyweight pattern, we need to divide Object property into intrinsic
and extrinsic properties. Intrinsic properties make the Object unique
whereas extrinsic properties are set by client code and used to perform
different operations. For example, an Object Circle can have extrinsic
properties such as color and width.

For applying flyweight pattern, we need to create a Flyweight factory that
returns the shared objects. For our example, let’s say we need to create a
drawing with lines and Ovals. So we will have an interface Shape and its
concrete implementations as Line and Oval. Oval class will have intrinsic
property to determine whether to fill the Oval with given color or not
whereas Line will not have any intrinsic property.

##### Flyweight Pattern Example in JDK
All the wrapper classes valueOf() method uses cached objects showing use
of Flyweight design pattern. The best example is Java String class String
Pool implementation.

Important Points
- In our example, the client code is not forced to create object using
Flyweight factory but we can force that to make sure client code uses
flyweight pattern implementation but its a complete design decision
for particular application.
- Flyweight pattern introduces complexity and if number of shared
objects are huge then there is a trade of between memory and time, so
we need to use it judiciously based on our requirements.
- Flyweight pattern implementation is not useful when the number of
intrinsic properties of Object is huge, making implementation of
Factory class complex.

#### 7. Proxy Pattern
Proxy Design pattern is one of the Structural design pattern and in my
opinion one of the simplest pattern to understand. Proxy pattern intent
according to GoF is:

`Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another
 object to control access to it`
 
The definition itself is very clear and proxy pattern is used when we want to
provide controlled access of a functionality. Let’s say we have a class that
can run some command on the system. Now if we are using it, its fine but if
we want to give this program to a client application, it can have severe issues
because client program can issue command to delete some system files or
change some settings that you don’t want. Here a proxy class can be created
to provide controlled access of the program.

### Behavioral Design Patterns
Behavioral patterns provide solution for the better interaction between
objects and how to provide lose coupling and flexibility to extend easily.

- Template Method Pattern
- Mediator Pattern
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Strategy Pattern
- Command Pattern
- State Pattern
- Visitor Pattern
- Interpreter Pattern
- Iterator Pattern
- Memento Pattern

#### 1. Chain of Responsibility Pattern
Chain of responsibility design pattern is one of the behavioral design
pattern. Chain of responsibility pattern is used to achieve lose coupling in
software design where a request from client is passed to a chain of objects to
process them. Then the object in the chain will decide themselves who will
be processing the request and whether the request is required to be sent to
the next object in the chain or not.

![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/chainOfResponsibility/ChainOfResponsibilityPatternClassDiagram.png)

##### Chain of Responsibility Pattern Examples in JDK
- java.util.logging.Logger#log()
- javax.servlet.Filter#doFilter()

##### Important Points
- Client doesn’t know which part of the chain will be processing the
request and it will send the request to the first object in the chain. For
example, in our program ATMDispenseChain is unaware of who is
processing the request to dispense the entered amount.
- Each object in the chain will have its own implementation to process
the request, either full or partial or to send it to the next object in the
chain.
Every object in the chain should have reference to the next object in
chain to forward the request to, it’s achieved by java composition.
- Creating the chain carefully is very important otherwise there might
be a case that the request will never be forwarded to a particular
processor or there are no objects in the chain who are able to handle
the request. In my implementation, I have added the check for the user
entered amount to make sure it gets processed fully by all the
processors but we might not check it and throw exception if the
request reaches the last object and there are no further objects in the
chain to forward the request to. This is a design decision.
- Chain of Responsibility pattern is good to achieve lose coupling but it
comes with the trade-off of having a lot of implementation classes and
maintenance problems if most of the code is common in all the
implementations.

#### 2. Command Pattern
Command Pattern is one of the Behavioral Design Pattern and it’s used
to implement lose coupling in a request-response model. In command
pattern, the request is send to the invoker and invoker pass it to the
encapsulated command object. Command object passes the request to the
appropriate method of Receiver to perform the specific action. The client
program create the receiver object and then attach it to the Command. Then
it creates the invoker object and attach the command object to perform an
action. Now when client program executes the action, it’s processed based
on the command and receiver object.

![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/command/CommandPatternClassDiagram.png)

##### Command Pattern JDK Example
Runnable interface (java.lang.Runnable) and Swing Action
(javax.swing.Action) uses command pattern.
##### Important Points
- Command is the core of this pattern that defines the contract for
implementation.
- Receiver implementation is separate from command implementation.
- Command implementation classes chose the method to invoke on
receiver object, for every method in receiver there will be a command
implementation. It works as a bridge between receiver and action
methods.
Invoker class just forward the request from client to the command
object.
- Client is responsible to instantiate appropriate command and receiver
implementation and then associate them together.
- Client is also responsible for instantiating invoker object and
associating command object with it and execute the action method.
- Command pattern is easily extendable, we can add new action
methods in receivers and create new Command implementations
without changing the client code.
- The drawback with Command pattern is that the code gets huge and
confusing with high number of action methods and because of so
many associations.

#### 3. Interpreter Pattern
Interpreter pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern and is used to
define a grammatical representation for a language and provides an
interpreter to deal with this grammar. The best example of this pattern is
java compiler that interprets the java source code into byte code that is
understandable by JVM. Google Translator is also an example of interpreter
pattern where the input can be in any language and we can get the output
interpreted in another language.

![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/interpreter/InterpreterPatternClassDiagram.png)

##### Important Points
- Interpreter pattern can be used when we can create a syntax tree for
the grammar we have.
- Interpreter pattern requires a lot of error checking and a lot of
expressions and code to evaluate them, it gets complicated when the
grammar becomes more complicated and hence hard to maintain and
provide efficiency.
- java.util.Pattern and subclasses of java.text.Format are some of the
examples of interpreter pattern used in JDK.

#### 4. Iterator Pattern
Iterator pattern in one of the behavioral pattern and it’s used to provide a
standard way to traverse through a group of Objects. Iterator pattern is
widely used in Java Collection Framework where Iterator interface provides
methods for traversing through a collection. According to GoF, iterator
design pattern intent is:

`Provides a way to access the elements of an
aggregate object without exposing its underlying
representation`

Iterator pattern is not only about traversing through a collection, we can
provide different kind of iterators based on our requirements. Iterator pattern
hides the actual implementation of traversal through the collection and client
programs just use iterator methods.

##### Iterator Pattern in JDK
We all know that Collection framework Iterator is the best example of
iterator pattern implementation but do you know that java.util.Scanner class
also Implements Iterator interface. Read this post to learn about Java
Scanner Class(https://www.journaldev.com/872/java-scanner-class-java-util-scanner).

##### Important Points
- Iterator pattern is useful when you want to provide a standard way to
iterate over a collection and hide the implementation logic from client
program.
- The logic for iteration is embedded in the collection itself and it helps
client program to iterate over them easily.

#### 5. Mediator Pattern

Mediator Pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern, so it deals with
the behaviors of objects. Mediator design pattern is used to provide a
centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.
According to GoF, mediator pattern intent is:

`Allows loose coupling by encapsulating the way
 disparate sets of objects interact and communicate with
 each other. Allows for the actions of each object set to
 vary independently of one another`
 
![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/mediator/MediatorPatternClassDiagram.png)

##### Mediator Pattern in JDK
- java.util.Timer class scheduleXXX() methods
- Java Concurrency Executor execute() method.
- java.lang.reflect.Method invoke() method.

##### Important Points
- Mediator pattern is useful when the communication logic between
objects is complex, we can have a central point of communication that
takes care of communication logic.
- Java Message Service (JMS) uses Mediator pattern along with
Observer pattern to allow applications to subscribe and publish data
to other applications.
- We should not use mediator pattern just to achieve lose-coupling
because if the number of mediators will grow, then it will become
hard to maintain them.

#### 6. Memento Pattern
Memento pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Memento
design pattern is used when we want to save the state of an object so that we
can restore later on. Memento pattern is used to implement this in such a
way that the saved state data of the object is not accessible outside of the
object, this protects the integrity of saved state data.

Memento pattern is implemented with two objects – Originator and
Caretaker. Originator is the object whose state needs to be saved and
restored and it uses an inner class to save the state of Object. The inner class
is called Memento and its private, so that it can’t be accessed from other
objects.

Caretaker is the helper class that is responsible for storing and restoring the
Originator’s state through Memento object. Since Memento is private to
Originator, Caretaker can’t access it and it’s stored as a Object within the
caretaker.

#### 7. Observer Pattern
Observer pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Observer design
pattern is useful when you are interested in the state of an object and want to
get notified whenever there is any change. In observer pattern, the object
that watch on the state of another object are called Observer and the object
that is being watched is called Subject. According to GoF, observer pattern
intent is:

`Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so
 that when one object changes state, all its dependents are
 notified and updated automatically.`
 
![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/observer/ObserverPatternClassDiagram.png)

Observer pattern is also called as publish-subscribe pattern. Some of it’s
implementations are;
- java.util.EventListener in Swing
- javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener
- javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener

#### 8. State Pattern
State pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. State design pattern
is used when an Object change its behavior based on its internal state.

If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can
have a state variable in the Object and use if-else condition block to perform
different actions based on the state. State pattern is used to provide a
systematic and lose-coupled way to achieve this through Context and State
implementations.

Context is the class that has a State reference to one of the concrete
implementations of the State and forwards the request to the state object for
processing.

The benefits of using State pattern to implement polymorphic behavior is
clearly visible, the chances of error are less and it’s very easy to add more
states for additional behavior making it more robust, easily maintainable and
flexible. Also State pattern helped in avoiding if-else or switch-case
conditional logic in this scenario.

#### 9. Template Method Pattern
Template Method is a behavioral design pattern and it’s used to create a
method stub and deferring some of the steps of implementation to the
subclasses. Template method defines the steps to execute an algorithm and
it can provide default implementation that might be common for all or some
of the subclasses.

![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/templateMethod/TemplateMethodPatternClassDiagram.png)

##### Template Method Pattern in JDK
- All non-abstract methods of java.io.InputStream, java.io.OutputStream, java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer.
- All non-abstract methods of java.util.AbstractList, java.util.AbstractSet and java.util.AbstractMap.

##### Important Points
- Template method should consists of certain steps whose order is fixed
   and for some of the methods, implementation differs from base class
   to subclass. Template method should be final.
- Most of the times, subclasses calls methods from super class but in
   template pattern, superclass template method calls methods from
   subclasses, this is known as Hollywood Principle – “don’t call us,
   we’ll call you”.
- Methods in base class with default implementation are referred as
   Hooks and they are intended to be overridden by subclasses, if you
   want some of the methods to be not overridden, you can make them
   final, for example in our case we can make buildFoundation() method
   final because if we don’t want subclasses to override it.

#### 10. Visitor Pattern
Visitor Pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern. Visitor pattern is
used when we have to perform an operation on a group of similar kind of
Objects. With the help of visitor pattern, we can move the operational logic
from the objects to another class.

![Class Diagram](src/behavioralDesignPatterns/visitor/VisitorPatternClassDiagram.png)

The benefit of this pattern is that if the logic of operation changes, then we
need to make change only in the visitor implementation rather than doing it
in all the item classes.

Another benefit is that adding a new item to the system is easy, it will
require change only in visitor interface and implementation and existing
item classes will not be affected.

The drawback of visitor pattern is that we should know the return type of
visit () methods at the time of designing otherwise we will have to change
the interface and all of its implementations. Another drawback is that if there
are too many implementations of visitor interface, it makes it hard to extend.

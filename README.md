## Design Patterns Overview
**Design Patterns** are very popular among software developers. A design
pattern is a well-described solution to a common software problem.
Some of the benefits of using design patterns are:
- Design Patterns are already defined and provides industry standard
approach to solve a recurring problem, so it saves time if we sensibly
use the design pattern.
- Using design patterns promotes reusability that leads to
more robust and highly maintainable code. It helps in reducing total
cost of ownership (TCO) of the software product.
- Since design patterns are already defined, it makes our code easy to
understand and debug. It leads to faster development and new
members of team understand it easily.

Java Design Patterns are divided into three categories â€“
**_creational_**, **_structural_**, and **_behavioral_** design patterns.
